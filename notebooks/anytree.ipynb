      "├── **Non-destructive changes**: These graph manipulations need to be non-destructive, i.e. we track the changes to the graph and can roll back to any previous state.\n",
      "├── **Artefacts**: Some nodes produce Artefacts as part of their processing. Artefacts can be of different types, such as Knowledge (e.g. researching something), Code, or changes the the graph structure. For example, when processing a Task with Subtasks, if all the subtasks are done, the Task can be marked as complete, which is a change to the graph.\n",
      "├── **AI assistance**: A special node type indicates that assistance from an AI is requested. The current node, its children and it's parents/siblings are passed as context to the LLM and its output is interpreted as a graph modification to the existing graph (perhaps with appropriate scoping). These changes can be reviewed by a human before being applied.\n",

    "\t- **DAG**: The system is based on nodes and edges in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). \n",
    "\t- **Markdown**: The current state of the DAG can be represented as a hierarchical bullet point list in Markdown format, with some custom additions to define different node types and represent back-linking (which wouldn't be possible with indented lists, as they are equivalent to tree structures)\n",
    "\t- **Graph rewriting**: Work on any project using this system can be expressed by manipulating the graph: expanding nodes, removing nodes, modifying edges, etc. Special rules ensure that the graph always remains in a valid state. \n",
    "\t- **Non-destructive changes**: These graph manipulations need to be non-destructive, i.e. we track the changes to the graph and can roll back to any previous state. \n",
    "\t- **Artefacts**: Some nodes produce Artefacts as part of their processing. Artefacts can be of different types, such as Knowledge (e.g. researching something), Code, or changes the the graph structure. For example, when processing a Task with Subtasks, if all the subtasks are done, the Task can be marked as complete, which is a change to the graph. \n",
    "\t- **AI assistance**: A special node type indicates that assistance from an AI is requested. The current node, its children and it's parents/siblings are passed as context to the LLM and its output is interpreted as a graph modification to the existing graph (perhaps with appropriate scoping). These changes can be reviewed by a human before being applied. \n",
